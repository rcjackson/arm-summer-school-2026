# 2026 ARM Big Open Data Summer School

**Monday, May 18, to Friday, May 22, 2026**

The “Big Open Data Science Summer School” is geared toward students from undergraduates to early postdoctoral scholars. Planned activities include instructional talks, tutorials, and a mentored hackathon for attendees to work with ARM data and open-source software.

## Mission
The overarching mission of the summer school is to enhance the scientific impact of ARM observations through the instruction of students in new techniques to gain insight into atmospheric processes using open science tools.

## Objectives
- increase knowledge about the range of ARM observations, demonstrate innovative and methodologically sound use of those observations, and connect students to a variety of knowledgeable resources (e.g., ARM instrument mentors)

- introduce students to resources within ARM for high performance data-proximate computation

- equip students with a variety of techniques for comparing high-resolution model output with ARM observations to study a range of atmospheric processes

- apply artificial intelligence techniques to ARM data applications.
